<div id = 'bio'>
<p>During my ten years working in all areas of video production, I have been driven by a love of storytelling and creative problem solving. As Director of Media Production for CorpU I set the creative and technical direction for a team of producers, editors, and animators. Together, we create compelling video content to help Fortune 500 companies develop their leaders and solve complex problems.</p>
<p>My enjoyment of those kinds of technical and creative challenges has also led to a passion for programming and web development. Over the last couple of years, I have been constantly growing as a developer and pushing myself to learn as much as possible about this new world. Itâ€™s a set of skills that I am bringing to my current career in video production and something that I hope will lead to future opportunities and challenges.</p>
